    <p> 
        Welcome to my Blog, my little corner on the internet,
        where I document my learnings as I explore the world of Code, Design, and Animation 
        to create visually engaging, interactive, and immersive experiences.
        
        Every now and then I also discuss ideas in the realm of Philosophy and Creativity.
        Feel free to explore some of these ideas as well.
    </p>

    <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>
