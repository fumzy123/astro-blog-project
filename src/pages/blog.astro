            Welcome to my Blog, my little corner on the internet,
            where I document my learnings as I explore the world of Code, Design, and Animation 
            to create visually engaging, interactive, and immersive experiences.
            
            Every now and then I also discuss ideas in the realm of Philosophy and Creativity.
            Feel free to explore some of these ideas as well.
        </p>
